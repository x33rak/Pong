# Pong
This repository is for the game Pong for the Game Boy Advance
I have included a main.c, gba.h, and Pong.gba file in this repo. 
You can use the Pong.gba in any Game Boy Advance Emulator to run this game. 

Use the 'z' and 'x' keys to control player 1. 
Use the 'up' and 'down' arrow keys to control player 2.
